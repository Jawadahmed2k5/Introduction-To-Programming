# Lecture no 3
 ## First C Program:
 ` #include <iostream.h>
 main()
 {
    cout <<"Welcome";
 } `

 ###### We will examine this code step by step;
 1. `#include`
 
* This is a pre-processor directive. It is not part of our program; it is an instruction to the compiler.
* It tells the compiler to include the contents of the file `iostream.h` in our program.
* . The compiler knows that it is a system file, and
therefore looks for it in a special place.
* The sign **#** is is known as **HASH** and also called **SHARP**.

2. `<iostream.h>`
* This is the name of the library definition file for all Input Output Streams.
* iostream.(***h***) is the name of the file in which has code to do that work for you.

3. `main()`
* This is the name of the function where the program starts execution.
* The parentheses `()` are used to indicate that it is a function.

4. `{}`
* . For every open brace there there must be a matching close brace.
* Braces allows to group together pieces of a program.
* Braces are very important in C programming; they enclose the blocks of program.

4. `Cout`
* This is known as out put stream in C and C++.
* It is used to print output on the screen.

5.`<<`
* This is the insertion operator.
* It is used to insert the value of a variable or a constant into the output stream.

` ; `
 * This is the end of the statement.
 * Mising of a semicolon at the end of statement 
   is a syntax error and  compiler will detect it.

   ### Variables:
   * During programming we need to store data. This data is stored in variables.
   * In Memory, there is numerical address for each location of memory (block). It is difficult for us to handle these numerical addresses in our programs.So we give names to these locations.These names are variables.
   * We call them variables because they can contain different values at different times.
   * In a program every variable has 
                              1. Name
                              2. Data type
                              3. Value
                              4. Memory location
                              5. Size
    * The variables having name, type,size and value are just empty boxes until we put something in it.
    * To put some values in variables we use Assignment Operator.("=") 

    ### Data Types:

    * A variable  must have a data type associated with it, for example it can have data types like integer, decimal numbers, characters etc.
    * The integor type stores integor values and character type variables stores characters.
    * The data type of a variable is determined by the type of value it can hold.
    * Different Data types have different sizes in memory, depending on machine and compilers.
    * They also affect how they are displayed. The **COUT** knows how to display digit and character.

    C language provides us to deal with different type of whole numbers, real numbers and character data.

    #### Whole Number:
    * Whole numbers are numbers without decimal points.
    * They are also known as integers.
    * The C language provides three data types to handle whole numbers.
    1. **int**
    2. **long**
    3. **short**

    #### int Data Type
    * it is mentioned as ‘int’ which is a reserved word of C, so we can not use it as a variable name. 
    * In programming before using any variable name we have to declare that variable with
its data type. If we are using an integer variable named as ‘i’, we have to declare it as
                                    `int i ;`
* The above line is known as declaration statement.
* When we declare a variable in
way, it reserves some space in memory depending on the size of data type and labels
it with the variable name. The declaration statement int i ; reserves 4 bytes of memory
and labels it as ‘i’. This happens at the execution time. 

## Sample Program 1 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x;
    int y;
    int z;

    x = 10;
    y = 20;
    z = x + y;

    cout << "x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "y = " << y << endl;
    cout << "z = x + y = " << z << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## output
`x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y = 30`

## short Data type:
* It is also a reserved word of C.
* We noted that the integer occupies four bytes in memory.So if we have to store a small integor like 5,10,20 four bytes would be used.
* To save memory we use short data type. It occupies 2 bytes in memory.
* And it can store numbers in range of -32768 to 32767.

## Sample Program 2
**This program uses short data type to store values**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    short x;
    short y;
    short z;

    x = 5;
    y = 10;
    z = x + y;

    cout << "x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "y = " << y << endl;
    cout << "z = x + y = " << z << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### long Data Type:
* On the other side if we have a very large whole number that can not be stored in an in then we use the data type long provided by C. So when we are going to deal with very big whole numbers in our program, we use long data type.
* It occupies 4 bytes in memory and can store numbers in range of -2147483648 to 2147483647.

## Real Numbers :
* The C language provides two data types to deal with real numbers.
1. Float.
2. Double.

### Float Data Type :
*  It occupies 4 bytes in memory and can store numbers in range of -3.4e+

## Sample Program 3
**This program uses short data type to store values**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    float x;
    float y;
    float z;

    x = 12.35;
    y = 25.57;
    z = x + y;

    cout << "x = " << x << endl;
    cout << "y = " << y << endl;
    cout << "z = x + y = " << z << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Output:
x=12.35
y=25.57
z=x+y=37.92

## Double Data Type :
* If we need to store a large real number which cannot be store in four bytes, then we
use double data type.
* It occupies 8 bytes in memory and can store numbers in range of -1.8e+
* If we need to store a large real number which cannot be store in four bytes, then we
use double data type.
* In Program, we use it as:
* double x = 345624.769123.

### char Data Type:
* The char data type is used to store a single character in a variable.
* It occupies 1 byte in memory.
* . By using char data type we can store characters in variables.
While assigning a character value to a char type variable single quotes are used
around the character as ‘a’.

### Sample Program 4
**This program uses char data type to store values**

```cpp
#include <iostream.h>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
    char x;
    x = ’a’; 
    cout << "The character value in x=";
    cout << x;
}
```
# Arithmetic Operators in C

In the C language, we have the usual arithmetic operators for:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

C also provides a special arithmetic operator called **modulus**. All these are **binary operators**, meaning they operate on **two operands**.

## Arithmetic Operators Table

| **Arithmetic Operation** | **Arithmetic Operator** | **Algebraic Expression** | **C Expression** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Addition                 | `+`                      | x + y                     | `x + y`          |
| Subtraction              | `-`                      | x – y                     | `x - y`          |
| Multiplication           | `*`                      | xy                        | `x * y`          |
| Division                 | `/`                      | x ÷ y or x / y            | `x / y`          |
| Modulus (Remainder)      | `%`                      | x mod y                   | `x % y`          |

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication behave as in algebra.

### Integer Division

When both operands are integers, **division yields an integer result**, truncating the fractional part.

- Example: `5 / 2` results in `2`, not `2.5`.

To obtain the actual decimal result, use **float data types**.

---

### Modulus Operator

The modulus operator `%` returns the **remainder** after division.

- Example:  
  - `5 % 2 = 1`  
  - `23 % 5 = 3`  
  - `107 % 10 = 7`

Note: The modulus operator works **only with integer operands**.

---

## Precedence of Operators

Operators are evaluated based on **precedence rules**:

### Evaluation Order

| **Operator** | **Operation**              | **Precedence**                     |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `( )`        | Parentheses                | Evaluated **first**                |
| `*`, `/`, `%`| Multiplication, Division, Modulus | Evaluated **second**, left to right |
| `+`, `-`     | Addition, Subtraction      | Evaluated **last**, left to right  |

### Key Notes:
- Parentheses `()` force the evaluation order.
- In nested parentheses, the **innermost** is evaluated first.
- Among `*`, `/`, and `%`, if more than one appears, the **leftmost** is evaluated first.

---

## Example

### What is the result of:  
```c
10 + 10 * 5
```
