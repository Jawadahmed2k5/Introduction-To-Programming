# Sample Program :
## Problem Statement:
        Calculate the average age of a class of ten students. Prompt the user to enter the age of 
        each student.
## Solution :
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int age1,  age2, age3,  age4,  age5,  age6,  age7, age8, age9, age10;
    int Totalage, Averageage;
    
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 1: ";
    cin >> age1;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 2: ";
    cin >> age2;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 3: ";
    cin >> age3;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 4: ";
    cin >> age4;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 5: ";
    cin >> age5;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 6: ";
    cin >> age6;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 7: ";
    cin >> age7;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 8: ";
    cin >> age8;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 9: ";
    cin >> age9;
    cout << "Enter the age of the student 10: ";
    cin >> age10;

    Totalage = age1 + age2 + age3 + age4 + age5 + age6 + age7 + age8 + age9 + age10;
    Averageage = Totalage / 10;

    cout << "Average Age Of Class is : " << Averageage;
    return 0;
}
```
## Output:
Please enter the age of student 1: 12

Please enter the age of student 2: 13

Please enter the age of student 3: 11

Please enter the age of student 4: 14

Please enter the age of student 5: 13

Please enter the age of student 6: 15

Please enter the age of student 7: 12

Please enter the age of student 8: 13

Please enter the age of student 9: 14

Please enter the age of student 10: 11

Average age of class is: 12
