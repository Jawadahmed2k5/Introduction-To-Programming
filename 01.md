# What is Programming:
                      Programming is a language for writing programs.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What is Program:
                  Program is a sequence of steps to solve a particular problem.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem Solving Methods:
1. Identifying the problem
2. Find Solutions
3. Define solution in steps
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Algorithm:
             Step by step procedure to solve problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             
# FlowChart:
            Pictorial representation of a program.

# Programing Langyages:
                       Set of words,symbols and functions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Types of Languages:
1. High Level   -------> Near to Human.
2. Low Level    -------> Near to Computers.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What Skills Are Needed?
1. Paying attention to detail
2. Think about the reusability.
3. Think about user interface
4. Understand the fact the computers are stupid
5. Comment the code liberally
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Why Programming is important?
                              Because it develops skills like
1. Deep Analysis
2. Critical Thinking
3. Attention to detail
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Program design recipe:
                       To design a program properly, we must:
1. Analyze a problem statement, typically expressed as a word problem.
2. Express its essence, abstractly and with examples. 
3. Formulate statements and comments in a precise language.
4. Evaluate and revise the activities in light of checks and tests.
5. Pay attention to detail. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Points to remember
                    The major points to keep in mind are:
1. Don’t assume on the part of the users
2. User Interface should be friendly 
3. Don’t forget to comment the code 
4. PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL
5. Program, program and program, not just writing code, but the whole process
of design and development.
