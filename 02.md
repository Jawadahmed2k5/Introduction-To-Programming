## Software Categories
                  Software is categorized into two main categories:
                  1. System Software
                  2. Application Software
 
### System Software
                     The system software controls the computer. It communicates with computerâ€™s hardware (key board, mouse, modem, sound card etc) and controls different aspects of operations. Sub categories of system software are:
                     1. Operating system
                     2. Device drivers
                     3. Utilities 
                     ### Operating system:
                     An operating system  is the program that manages all the other programs in a computer.
### Device drivers:
                   The device driver software is used to communicate between the devices and the computer.

 ### Utilty Software:
                     Utility software is a program that performs a very specific task, usually related to managing system resources. 
 ##### For Example:                    
                    You would have noticed a utility of Disk Compression.Whenever you write a file and save it to the disk, Compression Utility compresses the file (reduce the file size) and write it to the disk and when you request this file from the disk, the compression utility uncompressed the file and shows its contents.
> **_NOTE:_**
            The compilers and interpreters also belong to the System Software category.
