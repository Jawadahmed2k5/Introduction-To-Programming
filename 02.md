## Software Categories
                  Software is categorized into two main categories:
                  1. System Software
                  2. Application Software
 
### System Software
                     The system software controls the computer. It communicates with computer’s hardware (key board, mouse, modem, sound card etc) and controls different aspects of operations. Sub categories of system software are:
                     1. Operating system
                     2. Device drivers
                     3. Utilities 
                     ### Operating system:
                     An operating system  is the program that manages all the other programs in a computer.
### Device drivers:
                   The device driver software is used to communicate between the devices and the computer.

 ### Utilty Software:
                     Utility software is a program that performs a very specific task, usually related to managing system resources. 
 ##### For Example:                    
                    You would have noticed a utility of Disk Compression.Whenever you write a file and save it to the disk, Compression Utility compresses the file (reduce the file size) and write it to the disk and when you request this file from the disk, the compression utility uncompressed the file and shows its contents.
> **_NOTE:_**
            The compilers and interpreters also belong to the System Software category. 

            ### Application software: 
                        A program or group of programs designed for end users. For example a program for Accounting, Payroll, Inventory Control System, and guided system for planes.

# History of C Language — Key Points

##  Origins at Bell Labs (Late 1960s–Early 1970s)

* Developed from **BCPL** (1967, Martin Richards) and **B** (1970, Ken Thompson).
* Both were *typeless* languages, requiring programmers to manage types manually.
##  Dennis Ritchie’s Contribution (Early 1970s)

* Created **C language** by combining BCPL and B features, adding **data typing** and new features.
* Designed as a **general-purpose** language, but became renowned for systems programming.

##  UNIX Operating System

* Early UNIX versions were written in B; later transitioned to C.
* C became the **primary development language** for UNIX and its compilers.
##  C’s Power and Capabilities

* Enables **direct hardware control** (turn devices on/off, manipulate hard disks, control peripherals).
* Offers nearly **unlimited system control**, making it powerful but potentially risky if misused.

##  Widespread Adoption

* Rapid adoption across **educational and research institutions**.
* Became foundational in computer science education and research.

##  Emergence of Variations

* Universities and researchers introduced new features, resulting in **multiple C variants**.

##  Standardization Efforts

* **1983**: ANSI formed a technical committee to create a unified, machine-independent C standard.
* **1989**: ANSI C standard approved.
* **ANSI and ISO** collaborated to standardize C globally.
